Question: Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?

Approach:
I investigated two measure types: effective care and complications. I queried the top 5 measures of effective care across hospitals based on variance of score. I then queried the top 5 measures of complications across hospitals based on score variance and range of lower and upper estimate.

Conclusion:

Below are the Effective Care Measures and Complications Measures with the highest variabilities across hospitals:

Measure Name | effective care score Variance
ED1 | 10813.599074091115
