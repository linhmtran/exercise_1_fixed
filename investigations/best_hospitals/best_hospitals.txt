Question: What hospitals are models of high-quality care? That is, which hospitals have the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures?

Approach:
In order to understand which hospitals represent high quality care, we want to define 'high' score for quality. I assume that quality is measured by the measure score carried out for each hospital (and scoring system is the same for all measures). Given this assumption, I find the top quality hospitals by looking at the highest average score from effective care measures.

Conclusion:

Below are the top 10 hospitals with the highest average measure scores.
